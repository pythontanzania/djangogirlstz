# General Principles

> **ProTip** All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, even when many people are contributing to it.

- Don't try to prematurely optimize your code; keep it readable and understandable.
- Strictly enforce the agreed-upon style.
- If in doubt when deciding upon a style use existing, common patterns.

## Whitespace

> **ProTip** Only one style should exist across the entire source of your code-base.

- Use whitespace to improve readability.
- Always be consistent in your use of whitespace.

## Indentation

> **ProTip** Use an [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) file (or equivalent) to help maintain the basic agreed conventions.
> **ProTip** Configure your editor to "show invisibles" and/or to automatically remove end-of-line whitespace.

- Never mix spaces and tabs for indentation.
- Choose between spaces or tabs. Stick to your choice without fail.
