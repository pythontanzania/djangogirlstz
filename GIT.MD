## Branches

- Choosen names must be short and descriptive.

  ```bash
  #good
  $ git checkout -b laravel-passport-migration

  #bad - too vague
  $ git checkout -b fix-authentication
  ```

- Whenever possible, names should include a suffix corresponding to the issue identifier.

  ```bash
  #GitHub issue #10
  $ git checkout -b laravel-passport-migration-10
  ```

- Use _dashes_ to separate words.

- Branches must be deleted from remotes after being merged.

> **ProTip:** Use `git branch --merged | grep -v "\*"` to list merged branches.

## Commits

<div id="commits-basics"></div>

### Basics

- Each commit should be a single logical change. Don't make several logical changes in one commit. For example, if a patch fixes a bug and optimizes the perfomance of a feature, split it into two separate commits.

> **ProTip:** Use `git add -p` to interactively stage specific portions of modified files.

- Don't split a single logical change into to several commits. For example, the implementation of a feature and its tests should be in the same commit.

- Commits should be ordered logically. For example, if commit X depends on changes done in commit Y, then commit Y should come before commit X.

<div id="commits-messages"></div>

### Messages

> **ProTip:** Ultimately, think about what you need to know if you ran across the commit in a year from now.

- Use the editor, not the terminal, when writing a commit message.

      ```bash
      #good
      $ git commit

      #bad
      $ git commit -m "Quick fix"
      ```

  > **ProTip** Committing from the terminal encourages a mindset of having to fit everything in one line,
  > which _almost_ always results into a non-informative, ambigous, useless commit messages.

- The first line of the message contains the `type` and `title` summarizing all the changes made.

  ```bash
  type: This is a descriptive yet succint title
  ```

  - It must be **descriptive** yet **succint**.

  - It should not end with a period.

  - It should be no longer than 50 characters.

  - The title must be capitalized and written in imperative present tense.

  - The type can be one of these:

    - **fix:** fix bug issue
    - **feat:** add a new feature
    - **docs:** change documentation
    - **style:** format code; no code change
    - **refactor:** refactor production code
    - **test:** refactor tests; no code change
    - **chore:** update build tasks, configs, etc; no code change
    - **wip:** work in progress

- The commit title should be followed with a blank line and more thorough description.

  ```bash
  feat: Add a git commit message body

  Now the body, contains a more thorough description of the changes made wrapped in 72
  characters. See https://github.com/joshuamabina/styleguide
  ```

  - It should be wrapped in _72 characters_ and explain:

    - **why** the change is needed
    - **how** it addresses the issue
    - **what** _side-effects_ it might have

  - It should also provide any pointers to related resources.

- The footer is also optional and is used to reference issue tracker IDs.

  ```bash
  feat: Add footer to git commit message

  The footer is optional; it is used to reference issue tracker IDs.

  Closes #10
  ```

## Merging

> **ProTip:** Beware, altering published history is a common source of problems for anyone working on the project.

- Never rewrite history of the **master** branch or any other special branches.

- Before you merge your branch, rebase onto the branch its going to be merged to.

  ```bash
  [laravel-passport-migration] $ git fetch
  [laravel-passport-migration] $ git rebase origin/master
  [laravel-passport-migration] $ git checkout master

  [master] $ git merge laravel-passport-migration
  ```

- If your branch contains more than one commit, do not merge with a fast-forward.

  ```bash
  #good
  $ git merge --no-ff laravel-passport-migration

  #bad
  $ git merge laravel-passport-migration
  ```
